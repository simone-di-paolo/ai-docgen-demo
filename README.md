# Interactive AI-Generated Landing Page

This project is a modern and visually appealing interactive landing page built with React and Vite. It was designed and developed entirely by an AI to demonstrate rapid UI/UX implementation and modern web development practices.

## Features

The landing page is composed of four main sections, each implemented as a separate React component:

*   **Hero Section (`Hero.jsx`):** An impactful introduction with a gradient title, a descriptive subtitle, and a call-to-action button that smoothly scrolls to the interactive demo.
*   **Features Section (`Features.jsx`):** A grid of cards highlighting key features, with subtle hover animations.
*   **Interactive Demo (`InteractiveDemo.jsx`):** A live customization panel where you can change the site's theme color, font size, and toggle between dark and light modes in real-time.
*   **Showcase Section (`Showcase.jsx`):** A responsive image gallery with an elegant overlay effect on hover, revealing project titles and tags.

### Design & Styling

*   **Modern Aesthetics:** The UI follows a "dark mode first" approach with a clean, visually balanced layout.
*   **Engaging Micro-interactions:** Smooth animations, hover effects, and transitions are used throughout the application to enhance the user experience.
*   **Responsive:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Custom Styling:** All styles are written from scratch in `src/App.css`, utilizing CSS variables for easy theming.

## Original Vite + React README

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
